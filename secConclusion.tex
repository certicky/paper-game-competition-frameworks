\section{Conclusion}\label{secConclusion}

In this paper we have given an overview of the 3 major annual StarCraft AI competitions, introduced the open-source software powering them, and described some of the top performing bot participants. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:comps}, each year, participation in these competitions has continued to rise, as well as the number of games played between bots in the competitions. In the past 2-3 years, the bots in these competitions have become more strategically complex and functionally robust, employing a range of state-of-the-art AI techniques from the fields of heuristic search, machine learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. In addition to increased participation in competitions, there has been a surge interest by in RTS AI among AI industry research groups such as Facebook AI Research, Google DeepMind, and Baidu, each of which are currently doing RTS AI research and creating their own RTS AI agents. With this increased activity in the field of RTS AI from hobbyist programmers, academic institutions, and industry researchers, we are hopeful that we may see a StarCraft AI capable of challenging human experts within the next few years.
